ERROR: "Creation of service was not idempotent"
CAUSE: ECS service already exists in AWS but not in Terraform state

SOLUTION 1 - Import Existing Service (Recommended):
cd sensor-backend/terraform
terraform import aws_ecs_service.app_service sensor-app-cluster/sensor-app-service
terraform apply

SOLUTION 2 - Delete and Recreate:
aws ecs delete-service --cluster sensor-app-cluster --service sensor-app-service --force --region us-east-2
sleep 60
cd sensor-backend/terraform
terraform apply

SOLUTION 3 - Use Different Name:
Edit terraform/ecs-app.tf line 299:
Change: name = "sensor-app-service"
To:     name = "sensor-app-service-v2"

Then run: terraform apply

GITHUB ACTIONS FIX:
Already added import step to .github/workflows/deploy-to-cloud.yml
Just re-run the workflow - it will auto-import now
